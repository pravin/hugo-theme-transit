The theme follows the reader's operating system setting. The round button in the header switches between light and dark, and the choice is remembered in the browser.

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `defaultTheme = "auto"` | Follow the system |
| `defaultTheme = "dark"` | Start dark |
| `themeToggle = false` | Hide the button |

In dark mode the line colours are brightened so they stay clear against the dark background.
